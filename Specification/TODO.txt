
- oops, it looks like nextprot is writing \Processed wrong. it should be
  (1|40|PEFF:1027|signal sequence)
- Fix the nextprot or change the spec?
- Validator didn't catch this

- how should decoys be done?
If we have
  nxp:NX_P12345-1
as one entry. What should its decoy be?
  nxp:DECOY_NX_P12345-1
or
  decoy:NX_P12345-1
or
  decoy:DECOY_NX_P12345-1
